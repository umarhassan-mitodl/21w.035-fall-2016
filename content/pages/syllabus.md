Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

None

Course Overview and Goals
-------------------------

Throughout the course, we will discover how the successful communication of science to the public relies on many factors beyond grammar, including the expectations of the audience, the purpose of the writer, as well as the context and genre of the communication. By examining these factors we will improve our rhetorical knowledge, and develop strategies for succeeding in a variety of communication events (known as "rhetorical situations"). We will gain experience in generating and researching article ideas, interviewing scientists, and most importantly, translating complex scientific and technological developments into clear and engaging stories for the public. Ultimately, improving our writing, speaking, and rhetorical knowledge will help us succeed at MIT and beyond.

Grading

_Late Papers:_ Each day an article is submitted late, the grade is lowered by one-thrid of a letter (e.g. B to B-). For example, an "A" paper submitted ten days late becomes a D-. \*The absence or tardiness of a first draft also lowers the revised article grade.
