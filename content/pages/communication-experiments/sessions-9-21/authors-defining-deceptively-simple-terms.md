**HARD/HARDIER**

“We've begun putting in our summer crops. Our first tomatoes and corn have been in for over a week, purple and fairly shivering with cold. Our earliest peppers and eggplants were planted this week, and those tender babies, the cucumbers and squash, unhappy in the extreme, have spent their first night in the cold soil. The hardier crops (when farmers use the words _'hardy' and 'tender'_, they are almost always referring to plants' tolerance to cold and frost) like lettuce, arugula, radishes, etc. have been in the ground for a good month now, with little growth to show. The spinach has really seemed to enjoy the protracted spring, and the peas seem quite happy as well.”

—Brian Cramer, _Hutchins Farm Newsletter_, May 2016.

**NOISE**

“So although this book has the word _‘noise’_ prominently in its title, it is trying to stretch the definition as far as it will go – and in lots of directions, too. It encompasses not just music and speech, but also echoes, chanting, drumbeats, bells, thunder, gunfire, the noise of crowds, the rumbles of the human body, laughter, silence, eavesdropping, mechanical sounds, noise neighbours, musical recordings, radio, in fact pretty well anything that makes up the broader world of sound and of listening.”

—David Hendy, _Noise: A Human History of Sound and Listening_. 2013. Profile Books Ltd. Introduction ix.

**EXPERIENCE**

“Literally, an experience is anything that can be reflected upon. An experience could be anything from a few minutes listening to a song to an hour playing an in-depth simulation game. In this book, what I’m describing as an _experience_ is generally any activity that engages multiple senses simultaneously and is reflected upon afterward both individually and as a group.”

—David Smokler, _Interactive Learning Experiences_. 2005. Corwin Press. 2-3.
