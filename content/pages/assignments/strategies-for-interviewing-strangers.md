1. **Capture attention and interest in your initial contact (email/phone)**   
    - Introduce yourself (e.g. “I’m an MIT undergraduate student working on a class project…”)
    - Be transparent and explicit about the purpose of the communication _and_ the interview
        - Why are you contacting this person?
            - If sending an email, the subject line should indicate the purpose of the communication
        - Why do you want to interview them?
            - “I want to learn about you and your work…”
    - Why should this person take the time to respond?
        - Share what you hope to gain from the interview
        - Describe what you plan to do with the information provided
    - When do you need to meet?
        - Be _specific_ with the deadline!
            - This deadline should be well in advance of your assignment due date
    - How long will the interview take?
        - Be specific or provide an approximate range (e.g. 20-30min)
    - Where will the interview take place?
        - Be flexible with the location: what works best for the interviewee?
2. **Prepare targeted and open-ended questions**   
    - Focus on the person’s experiences
        - Resist the temptation to offer solutions
    - Prioritize your questions, as you will likely not be able to ask them all
    - Record the interview (audio), if possible, but ask for the interviewee’s permission
    - If you don’t yet have a photograph of the person, ask them for one, or take one
        - You can be creative: think back to the pic of the astronomer tying his shoe
3. **Plan to improvise**   
    - Ask “why?” after brief answers
    - Ask follow-up questions when you’re curious to learn more
    - Ask for explanations when you do not understand an answer
        - Listening to the _way_ in which they explain their work to others is likely valuable for your profile article
    - Don’t be afraid to go off script
    - Enjoy the conversation
4. **Be gracious and kind**   
    - Time is precious, they’ve given you a gift
    - Reiterate the impact of their help
    - This person might be a helpful contact in the future
5. **Have FUN**   
    - Interviewing strangers is an adventure of discovery!
