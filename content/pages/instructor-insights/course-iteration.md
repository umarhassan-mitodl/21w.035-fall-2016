_In this section, Jared Berezin discusses how he plans to modify future iterations of the course._

Based primarily on student feedback, I plan to continue the trend in this course of increasing the ratio of writing to reading. Specifically, Iâ€™d like to generate additional {{% resource_link 00a18794-dd94-2498-c20c-1c465351aa93 "communication experiments" %}} and incorporate them at targeted moments throughout the term. Increasing opportunities for active learning, in which students apply conceptual knowledge to real-time communication challenges, will further add to the energy of the classroom. This effort would coincide with a re-visiting of the {{% resource_link 20cfb4e0-1be3-a0c0-1f54-a6ff5863ea7d "assigned readings" %}}, in order to consider whether any texts can be removed, shortened (i.e. occasionally assigning targeted excerpts rather than full articles), or replaced by other media.
