## Communication Experiments and Reading Responses

Typically, a portion of class will be dedicated to discussing the homework readings and upcoming assignments. The rest of the class period will comprise of guided individual and group "communication experiments."

All of your experiments should be recorded in a notebook, which may be either a paper notebook or an electronic document. I recommend adhering to _either_ a hard copy or electronic format throughout the term, as you will occasionally be asked to submit your in-class writing (paper or electronic) at various points throughout the term. In addition, you will frequently be asked to bring {{% resource_link 20cfb4e0-1be3-a0c0-1f54-a6ff5863ea7d "written responses" %}} to assigned homework readings. I will announce the writing prompts in class, and your written responses should be recorded in your notebook (paper or electronic) and brought with you to the following class.
